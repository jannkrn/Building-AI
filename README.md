# Project Title

account clarification

## Summary

Account clarification is a tast, that many companys have to deal with. Costumers which have monthly differnt bills often pays incorrect amounts to incorrect times that donÂ´t fit the bill. To write reminder, so that companys get theire correct amount of money, companys need to break down the account and assign the Payments correctly to the bill. The programm could also add the reminder fees in the reminder.

## Background

My idea break the account down and sends warnings to the custumers automaticly. The problem is very common especially in property management. 

* problem 1: account clarification
* problem 2: reminder sending



## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?
The programm get the account and break it down. A person should have a quick look, if everything is corrcect he can send out the final reminder to the custumer.

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Pfoto](...)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src=<...>

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
